## About this Project
#### What Programming Language are People using for their BitCoin Related Repositories on GitHub?
#### Give me the README, and I'll Predict the Language.

### Project Goal:
The goal is to scrape README pages from BitCoin related repositories on GitHub, so that we can predict the language of that repository.

### Project Desciption: 
Language Predictor. This is a group project where we will be scraping GitHub repository README files related to BitCoin. Exploring the text in the README will allow us to identify We will then produce a classification model that will be able to predict the programming language of that repository using only the text in the README.
